**EXECUTION PROCESS:**
1. **Discovery Phase**: Analyze current website architecture, identify all functional issues, and catalog improvement opportunities
2. **Strategy Presentation**: Present your luxury transformation strategy with visual mockups and technical approach
3. **Approval Gateway**: Request explicit approval for any herocarousel modifications or major structural changes
