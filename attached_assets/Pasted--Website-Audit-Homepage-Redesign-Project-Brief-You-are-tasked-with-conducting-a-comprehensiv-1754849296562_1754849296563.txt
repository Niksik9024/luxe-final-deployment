**Website Audit & Homepage Redesign Project Brief**

You are tasked with conducting a comprehensive website audit and implementing a homepage redesign. Follow this structured approach:

## Phase 1: Pre-Redesign Website Audit (COMPLETE BEFORE ANY HOMEPAGE CHANGES)

### Critical Requirements:
1. **Full Site Functionality Check:**
   - Test every page's refresh behavior across all browsers
   - Document any data loss, content loading errors, or layout shifts on refresh
   - Ensure all pages load consistently and correctly every time

2. **Mobile Responsiveness Audit:**
   - Test all pages on mobile devices and various screen sizes
   - Identify and fix any responsive design issues
   - Verify touch interactions work properly on mobile

3. **Bug & Error Detection:**
   - Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
   - Test all interactive elements (forms, buttons, navigation)
   - Verify loading speeds and identify performance bottlenecks
   - Fix any broken links or missing resources

**MANDATORY:** Complete all fixes and verify the website is fully functional with zero issues before proceeding to Phase 2. Request approval before making any homepage changes.

## Phase 2: Homepage Redesign (Only After Phase 1 Approval)

### Design Guidelines:
1. **Layout Simplification:**
   - Reduce visual clutter by removing non-essential elements
   - Create more white space for improved readability
   - Streamline the number of sections displayed

2. **Visual Consistency Enhancement:**
   - Establish and apply a unified color palette site-wide
   - Standardize typography (font families, sizes, weights)
   - Implement consistent spacing and alignment across all components
   - Ensure design elements follow the same visual language

3. **Content Prioritization:**
   - Position the most critical information prominently
   - Remove visual distractions that compete with key messages
   - Create clear visual hierarchy through typography and spacing

### Specific Restrictions:
- **DO NOT modify the hero carousel functionality or structure**
- **ONLY adjust font-related properties** (size, weight, color, family) within the hero carousel
- Maintain all existing carousel features and behavior

## Deliverables:
1. Detailed audit report documenting all issues found and fixed
2. Before/after screenshots of the homepage redesign
3. Confirmation that all changes maintain mobile responsiveness
4. Final testing report confirming zero bugs or issues remain

**Remember:** No homepage modifications until you receive explicit approval after completing Phase 1.
